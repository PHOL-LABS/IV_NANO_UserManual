\chapter{Configuring with the IV-Conf web pack}\label{ch:web-config}

The IV-Conf web pack provides a browser-based interface for configuration and firmware updates. Access it at \url{https://phol-labs.com/iv} from a computer equipped with a USB serial bridge.

\section{Connecting to the indicator}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Open the web page and select the serial port assigned to the programmer.
    \item Set the baud rate to 115200 in the settings panel.
    \item Click \texttt{Connect MODBUS} and wait until the interface reports a successful connection with no error indicators.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Managing presets}
Multiple presets are available for each indicator type (for example, \texttt{IV-Volts}, \texttt{IV-Volts-Bar-Multi}, and \texttt{IV-Volts-BarYellow}). After selecting the correct preset:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Press \texttt{Send data} to upload the preset to the indicator.
    \item Use \texttt{Stop Send Data} to interrupt a transfer if you need to change settings.
    \item Press \texttt{Get data} to read the current configuration from the indicator before making adjustments.
\end{enumerate}

In addition to predefined presets, the web pack allows manual adjustment of colour gradients, input ranges, and dot/bar display mode. Always verify that the preset matches the physical indicator before applying changes.
