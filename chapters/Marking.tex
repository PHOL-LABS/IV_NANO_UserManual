\chapter{Marking and identification}\label{ch:marking}

Each indicator housing carries a product label with the device name, firmware revision, and manufacturing date. Record these values before installation to streamline future support requests.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Firmware revisions are shown in the IV-Conf tools after connecting to the indicator.
    \item The housing is not sealed with tamper stickers. Keep a record of the installation date for your maintenance logs.
    \item Serial numbers are located on the rear of the indicator next to the programmer port. Avoid scratching or covering this area.
\end{itemize}

Retain the original packaging and documentation; they contain QR codes and serialised information that assists PHOL-LABS Kft when providing replacements or paid repairs.
