\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}

IV-Indicators Nano is a modular family of button-style gauges engineered by PHOL-LABS Kft for Volkswagen Golf and Jetta Mk1/Mk2 platforms, Polo 86C models, and Audi 80 B2 vehicles. Each indicator shares the same physical format and programmer while offering specialised firmware to monitor different sensors. The line includes voltmeter, barometer, thermometer, lambda, and boost configurations shipped individually or as a bundled three-pack.

This manual consolidates the essential knowledge required to install, configure, and operate IV-Indicators Nano devices. It replaces all legacy Digifiz documentation and serves as the foundation for multilingual releases. Every chapter has been rewritten to match the new hardware, preparing the structure for detailed wiring diagrams, localisation updates, and future firmware refinements.

Readers should familiarise themselves with the safety warnings in \autoref{ch:precautions} before powering the hardware. Subsequent chapters describe the supplied accessories, supported sensors, configuration utilities, and the calibration workflow. Appendices provide quick-reference data such as the NTC temperature table used by the default thermometer preset.
