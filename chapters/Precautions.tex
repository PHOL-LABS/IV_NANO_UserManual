\chapter{Prohibitions and precautions}\label{ch:precautions}

The IV-Indicators Nano programmer is not a standalone accessory; it is part of the indicator electronics. Incorrect handling can immediately destroy the power regulation stage or short exposed pogo pins. Always set the device on an insulating surface and follow the rules below before applying power.

\section{Critical rules}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Never power the programmer outside the indicator.} Connecting the programmer to a USB phone or computer without the gauge attached will burn the electronics. Only energise the tool once it is fully seated in the indicator housing.
    \item \textbf{Do not insert the programmer into a powered indicator.} Make every mechanical connection with the system unpowered. Plug the programmer into the gauge first, verify that it sits straight, and only then connect the USB supply.
    \item \textbf{Do not attach or detach the programmer while it is live.} Disconnect the USB cable before removing the programmer from the indicator and keep movement to a minimum while data is being transferred.
    \item \textbf{Secure the gauge during programming.} Wobbling on a desk or dangling from a USB cable can bend pogo pins and cause shorts. Support the device so that the connector cannot shift.
    \item \textbf{Avoid conductive surfaces.} Laptop cases, vehicle bodywork, or bare metal benches will short the programming contacts even if the system appears to work briefly. Use a clean non-conductive mat at all times.
\end{enumerate}

    \textbf{Warranty notice.} No warranty or returns are available if the indicator was powered or programmed in ways that ignore these prohibitions. PHOL-LABS Kft can supply a replacement, but it will be billed to the customer.
