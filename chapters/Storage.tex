\chapter{Storage and transport}\label{ch:storage}

Store IV-Indicators Nano modules in a dry environment between 0~\textdegree{}C and 40~\textdegree{}C. Avoid stacking heavy objects on top of the packaging to protect the display window and programmer pins.

During transport, keep the indicators in their anti-static bags and ensure the programmer is disconnected from power. Do not leave the devices connected to a vehicle battery when the car is stored for long periods; disconnect the harness or remove the indicator from the socket.
