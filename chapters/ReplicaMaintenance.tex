\chapter{Sensor connections}\label{ch:connections}

The following guidance consolidates the wiring notes supplied with the HTML reference. Always verify polarity and connector orientation before applying power.

\section{Voltage monitoring}
Connect the voltmeter indicator to a switched 12~V supply and vehicle ground. Share the ground reference with the rest of the instrumentation and protect the feed with an inline fuse.

\section{Barometer}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sensor: VAG \texttt{03C906051A} supplied with 5~V.
    \item Connector: \texttt{8K0973703} (female) on the harness.
    \item Signal: single analogue output routed to the indicator input.
\end{itemize}

\section{Thermometer}
Use an Ossca\,01176 NTC thermistor or an equivalent part. Route both leads to the indicator harness and confirm resistance against the values listed in \autoref{app:temperature-table} before calibration.

\section{Lambda}
IV-Indicators Lambda is intended to work with two probes: the factory narrowband sensor and an additional Bosch LSU~4.9 connected to a wideband controller.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Narrowband sensors output 0.1--0.9~V and can be wired directly to the indicator after calibration.
    \item Wideband controllers (SLC Free, DIY-EFI TinyWB, Sigma Lambda Controller Free~2, and similar) provide a linear 0--5~V output that the indicator can display.
    \item Retain the stock ECU wiring and feed the controller's analogue output into the IV-Indicators harness.
\end{itemize}

\section{Boost}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sensor: Dacia \texttt{223657266R} (\texttt{161B0004}/\texttt{8200225971}).
    \item Supply: regulated 5~V with a common ground to the indicator.
    \item Connector: sealed three-pin plug such as Bosch \texttt{1928403966} when the OEM connector is unavailable.
\end{itemize}
