\chapter{Configuring with the IV-Conf Android beta}\label{ch:android-config}

An experimental IV-Conf Android application is supplied with each indicator set. Although the app is still in beta, it provides the quickest way to push presets and colour profiles from a phone or tablet.

\section{Connecting the programmer}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Plug the external programmer into the indicator.
    \item Connect a USB-C cable between the programmer and the Android device. If the phone lacks USB-C, use a powered hub or a USB-A to USB-C adapter.
    \item Grant USB permissions when prompted by the IV-Conf app.
    \item Tap \texttt{USB Connect} and wait for the status to show \texttt{Connected}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Selecting presets}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Open the menu (three-bar icon) and navigate to the \texttt{Settings} page.
    \item Choose a preset that matches the physical indicator (for example, Volts, Baro, Thermo, Lambda, or Boost).
    \item Press \texttt{Set parameters} and wait for the transmission to finish.
    \item Optionally adjust dot/bar display mode, segment colours, and backlight intensity using the on-screen controls.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Working with gradients}
The main view exposes a gradient editor. Select the number of segments (up to four) and pick colours and positions that suit the vehicle interior. Changes are written immediately after pressing \texttt{Set parameters}. Keep the indicator stationary while data is transferring.
