\chapter{Safety notices}\label{ch:safety}

IV-Indicators Nano gauges are intended for professional or enthusiast installations in Volkswagen Group classics. Observe the following practices during installation and use:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Disconnect the vehicle battery before wiring the indicator to prevent shorts while routing harnesses.
    \item Verify that each sensor connector is properly seated and strain-relieved. Avoid stretching the wires while the indicator is mounted in the dashboard.
    \item Calibrate the indicator only when the vehicle is stationary. Changes to ranges or colour gradients during driving can distract the driver.
    \item Protect the programmer and harness from moisture. The electronics are not sealed against liquids.
    \item Store unused modules in their anti-static packaging and keep them away from conductive debris.
\end{itemize}

Warranty coverage is void if the device was powered on a conductive surface, connected with reversed polarity, or used without following the precautions in \autoref{ch:precautions}. Paid replacements can be arranged with PHOL-LABS Kft when damage falls outside warranty conditions.
