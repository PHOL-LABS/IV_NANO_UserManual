\chapter{Preparation and installation}\label{ch:preparation}

Before installing an IV-Indicators Nano module, ensure the vehicle and workspace are prepared:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Disconnect the negative terminal of the vehicle battery.
    \item Identify the mounting location and ensure the harness reaches the relevant sensor.
    \item Complete all mechanical attachments---the indicator must be fixed in its housing before any power is applied.
    \item Route the sensor harness away from sharp edges and hot components. Use heat-resistant loom or conduit where necessary.
    \item Verify that the programmer port remains accessible so that future calibration steps can be completed without removing the indicator from the dashboard.
\end{enumerate}

Only after these steps are complete should the indicator be powered for configuration. Never move the device or unplug connectors while the programmer is energised.
